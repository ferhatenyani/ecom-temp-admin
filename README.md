# ecom-admin

The staff admin panel for the Algerian headless-commerce backend. Built from
[ADMIN_PANEL.md](ADMIN_PANEL.md), which is the specification and the place corrections get written
back to; [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) holds the product truth behind it.

Next.js 16.3 App Router, React 19.2, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4 with token-only theming,
`next-intl` for French and Arabic with full RTL, TanStack Query v5, `jose` for the sealed session
cookie. No component library.

## What exists

The shell, the credential boundary, and Orders end to end.

```
/[locale]/login              sign in with a WordPress Application Password
/[locale]/orders             list — filters in the URL, 30 s poll, five states
/[locale]/orders/[id]        detail — summary, items, totals, customer, COD, timeline
                             plus the status transition, which renders the API's 409
```

`fr` and `ar` are both complete, at 390–440 px and on a desktop. Everything else in Part V is a later
branch, and the tab bar renders those destinations as visibly not-yet-built rather than as links that
404.

## Running it

The backend must be up first — see `~/projects/ecom-temp`. It answers on `:8090`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local        # then set SESSION_SECRET to 32+ characters
npm install
npm run dev                       # http://localhost:3001/fr/orders
```

Sign-in needs a real staff Application Password, because every staff member authenticates as
themselves — there is no service account, by design, so the audit trail names a person.

```bash
CRED=$(scripts/mint-credential.sh ac_super_admin)
echo "$CRED"                      # login:password
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test                          # types → design → unit → e2e
npm run test:design               # the non-negotiables, with a floor and a self-check
npm run test:unit                 # formatters, error mapping, envelope, seal, allowlist
npm run test:e2e                  # four device widths × both locales
npm run shots -- <user> <pass>    # captures + assertions into .impeccable/review/
```

`scripts/test.sh` mints its own credentials and clears the API's rate-limit counters first — the suite
provokes a login failure on purpose, and the failed-login bucket would otherwise refuse the correct
password for the next fifteen minutes.

The e2e suite runs on Chromium at current iPhone widths. `--project=phone-webkit` is the honest engine
and needs `sudo npx playwright install-deps webkit` once.

## The rules that are enforced, not just written down

`scripts/check-design.sh` fails the build on any of these, scans 45 files, and asserts a floor plus a
positive control on its own patterns — a grep that matches nothing must not report success.

- No gradients, no accent bars, no component library, no generic fonts.
- No colour outside `styles/tokens.css`. One exception, `lib/theme-color.ts`, named in the script with
  its reason and asserted by a unit test.
- No arbitrary Tailwind values.
- Logical properties only: `ms-`/`me-`/`ps-`/`pe-`/`start-`/`end-`, never `ml-`/`pr-`/`left-`.
- No `shadow-` outside `Sheet`, `Popover` and `ActionSheet`.

## Things worth knowing before changing anything

Measured against the live API, and each one is written up in ADMIN_PANEL.md as a
`> **Corrected in the build:**` note beside the passage it corrects.

- **A 401 is detected by status, never by `error.code`** — a wrong password answers
  `incorrect_password`, a suspended account `account_suspended`. Only a 401 clears the session; a 403
  is a screen state.
- **`/orders` has no `wilaya` filter**, and unknown query parameters are ignored with a 200 rather than
  refused. `?status=` takes one value; `?per_page=500` is a 400, not a clamp.
- **The 409 body is the authority** on which status moves are legal. `allowed: []` means the order is
  finished. The panel carries no transition table.
- **`notes[].created_at` has no UTC offset** while `order.date_created` does — `new Date()` silently
  shifts the first by the host's offset.
- **Timeline summaries contain HTML entities** (`99&rarr;98`), decoded to text and never to HTML.
- **`/settings` publishes no timezone.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_TIMEZONE` does, defaulting to
  `Africa/Algiers`.
- **Money needs `fr-DZ`**, not `fr` — a bare `fr` renders `DZD` where the shop says `DA`.
- **Zod parses responses on the server**, where its weight is free. It cost 60 KB gzipped in the
  browser on a two-field login form.
- **390 × 844 is the floor, not the target** — it is the narrowest iPhone Apple still sells.

## Open, and owed to the backend

- `name_ar` is empty for **Algiers (16)** and **Oran (31)** in `/locations/wilayas`, the two
  highest-traffic wilayas; the panel falls back to the Latin name, but the data should carry `الجزائر`
  and `وهران`.
- `name` for wilaya 16 is the English *Algiers* rather than the French *Alger*.
- `/settings` could reasonably publish `store.timezone`.
